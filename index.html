			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			 My name is Amberly and I am a recent grad from Washington and Lee University. I studied math and art, which are my two passions in life. To me, there are only a few things that are more satisfying than solving a complex problem. In my spare time, I enjoy practicing my makeup skills, playing video games, and hanging out with my family. I am a great lover of music as well, and I sang in my college choir for four years. <br />
			 Some of my other pastimes include watching sports. I am a great fan of ice hockey and I cheer for the San Jose Sharks. I also love to watch movies and television shows. Although I am always ready for a good new show, I still enjoy reruns of <i>The Office</i> and catching up on <i>Game of Thrones</i>. My current favorite shows are <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>, <i>The Good Place</i>, and <i>Steven Universe</i>.
